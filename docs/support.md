# Supported releases

## Naja 3.0

Naja 3.0 is currently in release candidate stage. It is an evolutionary release and should not come with any breaking changes for the majority of users. The breaking changes are mostly expected to affect advanced users, and developers who build custom extensions on top of Naja.

That said, there have been some changes in the inner workings of the snippet cache that may alter the behaviour, so it is strongly recommended that you properly test your application against the 3.x release, and [report any issues](https://github.com/naja-js/naja/issues/new/choose).

Please refer to the [release notes](https://github.com/naja-js/naja/releases/tag/3.0.0-rc.1) for the overview of breaking changes.

Naja 3.0 is expected to be released on February 24, 2024.
